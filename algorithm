Goal: To generate a simulated obstacle course that the player and the champion race in.
	Moving forward and backward different ammounts of distance across the console based on the chance 
	of failing or completing said obstacle that is chosen for them.
	
Input: There is no input required by the user for this program.

Output: The output will show in detail a race of A and B.

		A being the "Player" and B being the "Champion" the players better at racing friend.

		This will lead to showing the progress of A and B repeatedly until one of them reaches the "finish line" of value 50.
		
Requirements: We will need advanceRacerA which will be selecting and changing RacerA, advanceRacerB which will do the same for RacerB.

			  We will also need printPosition which will print the positions with each obstacle as the main function loops until one hits 50.
		
Details: When the program is run it will first select an obstacle randomly.

		 It will then in the loop make its way to the obstacle which will then change RacerA or RacerB's "distance"
		 in the race. Either adding or subtracting from its current position.
		 
		 Printing out the locations of A and B after each one goes through an obstacle. 
		 
		 This repeats while they are both < 50. Stopping when one of the two reach 50 which is the "finish line".
